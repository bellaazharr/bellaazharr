To be precise, my goal or dream is to be as successful as my mother in the future as a data 
engineer and learn a lot more things and skills in order to keep up with the upcoming 
technologies henceforward. 
Design thinking affects my goal subtly in making decisions in a better way. Now that I have 
already learned design thinking in this subject, it helps me in making things easier in my vision 
in order to solve problems even in my daily routine in a more professional and ethical way. 
I think one of the improvements which has to be done by me in order to improve my potential 
in the industry is to rectify my soft skills. In reality, we have to communicate with our 
colleagues and clients in order to maintain the productivity and the effectiveness of our work. 
That shows how crucial soft skills are in the industry.
